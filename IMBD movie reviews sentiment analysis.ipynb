You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams\\' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master\\'s of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional \\'dream\\' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell\\'s murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.'"

       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""

       "'one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you ll be hooked  they are right  as this is exactly what happened with me the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn t dare  forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance   oz doesn t mess around  the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience  watching oz  you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing    thats if you can get in touch with your darker side '"
